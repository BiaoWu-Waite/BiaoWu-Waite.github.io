 
I work at Multimodal Agent Researcher < img src='./images/tiktok.png' style='width: 6em;'> as a Phd now in [UTS NLP Group](https://utsnlp.github.io/), advised by [Prof. Ling Chen](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Ling.Chen) and [Prof. Meng Fang](https://mengf1.github.io/). 


I graduated from JiangSu University with a bachelor's degree and from the Department of Computer Science and Technology,  University of Adelaide with a master's degree, advised by [Yutong Xie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ddDL9HMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Yifan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ksQ4JnQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I also collaborate with  [Zeyu Zhang](https://steve-zeyu-zhang.github.io/) from [Australian Institute for Machine Learning](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/) < img src='./images/microsoft_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;"> closely.



My research interests include multimodal representation learning, LLM-based Agent and multimodal Agent. I have published 1 paper <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4FA6C0AAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD. 

To promote the communication among the Chinese ML & NLP community, we (along with other 11 young scholars worldwide) founded the [MLNLP community](https://space.bilibili.com/168887299) in 2021. I am honored to be one of the chairs of the MLNLP committee.
